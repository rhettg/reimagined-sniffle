### Product Design Document

#### 1. Overview
This document outlines the design for a simple personal web product that functions as a feed for images, text, and links. The product will allow content to be posted or dropped on the page and will display it in a persistent, organized list. The primary goal is to create a minimal and efficient tool for personal use, leveraging a Rails stack with Turbo and Stimulus for the front end, and using Tailwind for CSS.

#### 2. Features and Functionality

##### Core Features
- **Content Types**:
  - Images (initial support)
  - Text (including notes)
  - Links (with metadata fetching, embedded YouTube videos, and embedded tweets)
  - Future support for videos

- **Content Interaction**:
  - Ability to tag content for better organization
  - Notes can be added to any content item
  - Ability to remove items from the feed

- **Content Organization**:
  - Tagging system for categorizing content
  - Date and time metadata displayed subtly
  - Feed displayed in reverse chronological order (most recent items first)

- **Content Handling**:
  - Drag and drop for uploading files
  - Text box for pasting links or typing notes
  - Infinite scrolling for seamless content viewing
  - Search functionality (later priority)

- **APIs**:
  - RSS feed for the content
  - JSON API for accessing the feed

#### 3. User Experience

##### Content Addition
- **Drag and Drop**:
  - Users can drag files (images) directly onto the page to upload
  - Files dropped into the text box are processed and added to the feed

- **Text Box Input**:
  - Users can paste links or type notes into a designated text box
  - The system will fetch metadata for links (e.g., title, description, thumbnail)
  - YouTube links will embed playable videos, and tweets will display embedded tweets

##### Content Display
- **Feed Layout**:
  - Content items displayed in a single-column feed
  - Each item shows the content (image, text, link preview) with subtle metadata (date/time)
  - Feed displayed in reverse chronological order
  - Infinite scrolling to load more content as the user scrolls down

- **Tagging and Notes**:
  - Each content item can have tags added for organization
  - Notes can be added to provide additional context

- **Removing Items**:
  - Users can remove items from the feed as needed

##### Search and Navigation
- **Search**:
  - Simple search functionality to find content by keywords (implemented later)
- **Navigation**:
  - Smooth scrolling and minimal navigation elements for an uncluttered experience

#### 4. Technical Implementation

##### Front-End
- **Framework**: Turbo and Stimulus for interactivity
- **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS for a clean and modern design

##### Back-End
- **Framework**: Rails 7 for handling requests, data storage, and API endpoints
- **Database**: SQLite for storing content metadata and tags
- **Storage**: Local file system for storing uploaded images and media

##### APIs
- **RSS Feed**: Generated from the content feed, providing a way to subscribe to updates
- **JSON API**: Endpoint to access the feed data programmatically

#### 5. Future Considerations
- **Video Support**: Adding support for video uploads and playback
- **Advanced Search**: Implementing more robust search capabilities
- **Additional Content Types**: Expanding to support documents and other media types
- **Mobile Optimization**: Ensuring the interface is fully responsive and works well on mobile devices

#### 6. Privacy and Security
- **Privacy**: As a personal tool, privacy considerations are minimal, but ensuring data is securely stored locally is important
- **Security**: Basic security measures to protect the integrity of the stored content
